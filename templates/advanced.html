<h2>Branching</h2>

<p>Branching is a way to create multiple versions of your code. This can be useful for experimenting with different changes or for working on different features at the same time.</p>

<p>To create a branch, you can use the following command:</p>

<code>git branch new-branch-name</code>

<p>This command will create a new branch called "new-branch-name".</p>

<h2>Merging</h2>

<p>Merging is a way to combine two or more branches into a single branch.</p>

<p>To merge a branch, you can use the following command:</p>

<code>git merge branch-name</code>

<p>This command will merge the "branch-name" branch into the current branch.</p>

<h2>Using the Command Line</h2>

<p>The Git command line tool is a powerful tool that can be used to perform a variety of tasks, such as creating repositories, pushing code to repositories, and branching and merging.</p>

<p>For more information on using the Git command line tool, please visit the Git website.</p>
